                    <h2>Gothic</h2>
                    <p>Gothic script and Gothic font may refer to:  </p>
                    <p>Blackletter (Gothic minuscule, 'Old English') an ornate calligraphic or typographical style originating in Western Europe</p>
                    <p>Fraktur, a form of Blackletter</p>
                    <p>Schwabacher, a form of Blackletter</p>
                    <p>Gothic alphabet, the Greek-derived writing system of the Gothic language</p>
                    <p>Sans-serif, or gothic, a typographical style without serif decorations. In typography, this is the meaning usually associated with the term 'gothic font', for example Century Gothic. </p>
                    <p>East Asian Gothic typeface, a Chinese, Japanese or Korean typographical style without serifs or analogous decorations</p>
                    <p>Visigothic script, a script style used by Visigoths in Iberia</p>
                    <p>Gothic script originated from Carolingian script through a progressive modification of the pen-strokes, caused by a change in aesthetic perception and the adoption of an obliquely cut feather pen that allowed for a quicker style of writing which in turn accentuated the tendency to reduce curves by breaking the pen-strokes in their proximity. The gothic script is mainly characterized by an angularity of its strokes, the breaking of the curves, as well as the uniformity, regularity, and rhythm of its signs</p>
